# SCP-294 OpenAI Emulator

## Overview

This project is a fun emulator of SCP-294, the anomalous coffee machine from the SCP Foundation. Users can enter their desired "drink" (in reality, any concept or phrase), and the emulator will generate a description of the dispensed item and its effects, using OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model. 

## Features

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface mimicking a vending machine.
- Interaction with OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model via API to generate responses.
- Custom modal dialog alerts to handle API key requirement.
- Pouring liquid animation using CSS3.
